<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#introduction"></a>
</h2>
<p>This vignette describes how to use the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em> package for analyzing and integrating the results from Differential Expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis.</p>
<p>This package provides a Shiny application that aims to combine at different levels the existing pieces of the transcriptome data and results, in a way that makes it easier to generate insightful observations and hypothesis - combining the benefits of interactivity and reproducibility, e.g. by capturing the features and gene sets of interest highlighted during the live session, and creating an HTML report as an artifact where text, code, and output coexist.</p>
<p>In order to use <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em> in your workflow, the following inputs are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>dds</code>, a <code>DESeqDataSet</code> containing the expression matrix;</li>
<li>
<code>res_de</code>, a <code>DESeqResults</code>, i.e. a <code>DataFrame</code> storing the results of the differential expression analysis;</li>
<li>
<code>res_enrich</code>, a <code>data.frame</code> with the results of functional enrichment analysis;</li>
<li>
<code>annotation_obj</code>, a <code>data.frame</code> with the correspondence between identifiers for the features under inspection in the <code>dds</code> object.</li>
</ul>
<p>This workflow has mainly been tested with expression matrices with Ensembl identifiers, which are consistent and unambiguous across different releases, and results from functional enrichment analysis originating from ORA (OverRepresentation Analysis) methods, on the Gene Ontology signature database. It may need to be slightly adjusted to work with other formats and sources, but the core functionality will remain available.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this vignette, we will illustrate the main features of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em> on a publicly available dataset from Alasoo, et al. “Shared genetic effects on chromatin and gene expression indicate a role for enhancer priming in immune response”, published in Nature Genetics, January 2018 <span class="citation">(Alasoo et al. 2018)</span> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0046-7" class="external-link">doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0046-7</a>.</p>
<p>The data is made available via the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/macrophage" class="external-link">macrophage</a></em> Bioconductor package, which contains the files output from the Salmon quantification (version 0.12.0, with Gencode v29 reference), as well as the values summarized at the gene level, which we will use to exemplify.</p>
<p>In the <code>macrophage</code> experimental setting, the samples are available from 6 different donors, in 4 different conditions (naive, treated with Interferon gamma, with SL1344, or with a combination of Interferon gamma and SL1344). We will restrict our attention on the comparison between Interferon gamma treated samples vs naive samples.</p>

<p>To install this package, start R and enter:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="kw">if</span> <span class="op">(</span><span class="op">!</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ns-load.html" class="external-link">requireNamespace</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"BiocManager"</span>, quietly <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">TRUE</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span>

<p>Once installed, the package can be loaded and attached to your current workspace as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="kw"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html" class="external-link">library</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st"><a href="https://github.com/federicomarini/GeneTonic" class="external-link">"GeneTonic"</a></span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you have all four input elements ready, you can launch the <code><a href="../reference/GeneTonic.html">GeneTonic()</a></code> app by running:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/GeneTonic.html">GeneTonic</a></span><span class="op">(</span>dds <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">dds_object</span>,

          project_id <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"myFirstGeneTonic"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In this vignette, we showcase the functionality of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em> using the gene-level summarized version of the <code>macrophage</code> dataset. If you want to dive in and start playing with the app immediately, you can simply run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/example.html" class="external-link">example</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"GeneTonic"</span>, ask <span class="op">=</span> <span class="cn">FALSE</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Otherwise, you can follow the next chunks of code to generate the required input objects, step by step. In case some formatting requirements are expected, these will be specified in the text/comments, and they will be checked internally upon launching the <code>GeneTonic</code> app.</p>
<p>For running <code>GeneTonic</code>, you will need the four components mentioned above as parameters.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code>dds</code>: First you will need a <code>DESeqDataSet</code>, which is the main component in the <code>DESeq2</code> framework and extends the widely adopted <code>SummarizedExperiment</code> class. This object will store the information related to the expression matrix.</li>
</ol>

<p><code>res_de</code>: Next you are going to need the results of Differential Expression analysis, computed on the <code>dds_macrophage</code> object you just obtained.</p>
<p>The expected format is a <code>DESeqResults</code> object. Here we are going to contrast two different conditions, <code>IFNg</code> and <code>naive</code>, while controlling for the cell line of origin (which has 6 levels, namely naive, IFNg, IFNg_SL1344, and SL1344).</p>
<p>We start by filtering lowly expressed features (at least 10 counts in at least 6 samples - 6 being the size of the smallest group). Then, we test against a null hypothesis of a log2FoldChange of 1 (instead of the default value of 0), in order to specify that we want to call DE genes with a consistent <em>and</em> robust expression change. Finally, we add the gene symbol to the output <code>DataFrame</code>.</p>

<h2 id="userinterface">Description of the <code>GeneTonic</code> user interface<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#userinterface"></a>
</h2>
<p>The <code>GeneTonic</code> app is built with <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny" class="external-link">shiny</a></em>, and its layout is built around the components of <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bs4Dash" class="external-link">bs4Dash</a></em>, a modern looking dashboard based on Bootstrap 4.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="header-navbar">Header (navbar)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#header-navbar"></a>
</h3>
<p>The dashboard navbar (as it is called in <code>bs4Dash</code>) contains two dropdown menus, which can be expanded by clicking on the respective icons (<i class="fa fa-book"></i> and <i class="fa fa-info"></i>). These provide additional buttons to do one the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i class="fa fa-book"></i> inspect the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em> vignette (either the one installed in bundle with the package, or the online version)</li>
<li>
<i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> read some first help information on <code>GeneTonic</code> (What the package does in brief, what is required to run properly)</li>
<li>
<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> display information about the current session (via <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/sessionInfo.html" class="external-link">sessionInfo()</a></code>)</li>
<li>
<i class="fa fa-heart"></i> show some general information on <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em>, like where to find its development version (and contribute to that), or how to cite this tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, one fundamental button is present in the navbar:</p>
<button class="btn btn-default action-button ml-5" id="bookmarker" style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #ac0000; border-color: #ffffff" type="button">
<i class="fa fa-heart" role="presentation" aria-label="heart icon"></i>
Bookmark
</button>
<p>. This serves the purpose of bookmarking genes and gene sets of interest while exploring your data in an interactive session. This functionality will be exploited in the <i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> section of the app, where a complete HTML report can be generated as a reproducible artifact.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="sidebar">Sidebar<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sidebar"></a>
</h3>
<p>On the left side of the app, by clicking on the <i class="fa fa-bars"></i> icon (or if the app is viewed in full screen, by simply moving the mouse over to the left side), the sidebar menu is triggered. This constitutes the main way to access the different tabs of <code><a href="../reference/GeneTonic.html">GeneTonic()</a></code>, which will be explained in more detail in the next section (@ref(functionality)).</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="controlbar">Controlbar<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#controlbar"></a>
</h3>
<p>The controlbar is triggered by clicking on the cogs <i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> icon on the upper right part of the navbar. There you can find widgets that control the appearance of output (plots, tables, graphs) in multiple tabs of the main application, such as for example the number of gene sets to focus your attention on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="body">Body<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#body"></a>
</h3>
<p>The main body of the <code>GeneTonic</code> application is structured in tabs that are activated by clicking on the respective icons or text in the sidebar.</p>
<p>While the Welcome tab might be self-explanatory, the functionality of each tab can go in depth, and new users can benefit of the</p>
<button id="tour" type="button" class="btn btn-default action-button" style="color: #0092AC; background-color: #FFFFFF; border-color: #ffffff">
<i class="fa fa-question-circle" role="presentation" aria-label="question-circle icon"></i>

</button>
<p>button to trigger an interactive tour of <code>GeneTonic</code>, which allows users to learn the basic usage mechanisms by doing. During a tour, the highlighted elements respond to the user’s actions, while the rest of the UI is kept shaded. Tours can be interrupted anytime by clicking outside of the focused window, and arrows (left, right) can be used as well to navigate between steps. The tour functionality is provided by the beautiful <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rintrojs" class="external-link">rintrojs</a></em> package.</p>

<h2 id="functionality">The <code>GeneTonic</code> functionality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#functionality"></a>
</h2>
<p>The main <code>GeneTonic</code> app is structured in different panels, and each of these is presented in detail in the subsequent sections.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-welcome-panel">The Welcome panel<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-welcome-panel"></a>
</h3>
<p>This panel in intended to give an overview on the different ingredients you just provided for launching <code>GeneTonic</code>.</p>
<p>Collapsible elements, colored each by the typology of data it refers to, contain the underlying tabular information, and a value box provides a quick summary on the dimensions of the input parameters.</p>
<p>The tables are rendered with <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/DT/man/datatable.html" class="external-link">DT::datatable</a></code>, which provides a practical interface for exploring, sorting, and filtering. This framework is also extendable, for example as we do for the <code>log2FoldChange</code> column in the <code>res_de</code> object, where the values are also visually encoded as diverging bars of different color based on the expression change direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-gene-geneset-panel">The Gene-Geneset panel<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-gene-geneset-panel"></a>
</h3>
<p>This panel has as its main component an interactive bipartite graph illustrating the relationship between genesets and genes that belong to them. One of the relevant parameters for this output is the number of gene sets to be displayed, adjustable from the widget in the control panel on the right.</p>
<p>Such a representation is particularly useful to see overlap between terms, and grasp the way how different genes may play a concerting role in different processes.</p>
<p>The color and shape of the nodes depend on the entity they are related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>genes are shown as ellipses, colored with a palette diverging from a neutral color to red (log2FC &gt; 0) or to blue (log2FC &lt; 0)</li>
<li>gene sets are enclosed in gold boxes</li>
</ul>
<p>The interactivity in this graph is essential for zooming, panning, and selecting its nodes. The node selection, in particular, triggers a drill-down exploration, which populates a box on the right side, either with a signature heatmap (for a gene set), or with an expression plot, split by the experimental covariates of interest (for a gene) - this behavior can be controlled by the “Group/color by” selectize widget in the control sidebar. In both cases, some HTML content is also generated, with buttons linking to external databases where to retrieve additional information (e.g. ENSEMBL, NCBI, AmiGO, …).</p>
<p>A demonstration of how to use this panel effectively is provided by the tour, triggered by clicking on the</p>
<button id="tour" type="button" class="btn btn-default action-button" style="color: #0092AC; background-color: #FFFFFF; border-color: #ffffff">
<i class="fa fa-question-circle" role="presentation" aria-label="question-circle icon"></i>

</button>
<p>button in the upper right corner of the tab.</p>
<p><strong>Bookmarking from the Gene-Geneset panel:</strong> When clicking on the Bookmark button while in this tab, it is possible to add to the shortlisted items of interest both genes and gene sets. To do so, while one of the nodes is selected, click on the button with the mouse - or alternatively, click on the Left Ctrl button of your keyboard. A notification will be triggered, informing the status of the bookmarked elements.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-enrichment-map-panel">The Enrichment Map panel<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-enrichment-map-panel"></a>
</h3>
<p>This panel, similar to the Gene-Geneset tab, has again an interactive graph of a subset of the gene sets (you can control again the number of included sets from the control sidebar). This is also called an enrichment map - it is also possible to generate them in tools such as Cytoscape. In this case, the genesets are directly connected by an edge, where the thickness encodes the degree of similarity (e.g. in terms of overlap) between them; sets below a similarity threshold are not displayed for the sake of better clarity.</p>
<p>The size of the node encodes the information of the number of genes detected as Differentially Expressed (from the column <code>gs_de_count</code>), while the color is representative of the computed Z score for each set. This value is computed as <span class="math inline">\(z = \frac{(upgenes - downgenes)}{\sqrt{(upgenes + downgenes)}}\)</span> and is indicative of the expression changes of the genes assigned to a particular set. Please, keep in mind that methods based on overrepresentation analysis only do not account for the topology that might be behind the set of interacting features (i.e. an upregulated gene involved in inhibition of a pathway would still be counted as a positive element in the equation above).</p>
<p>The <code>z_score</code> and <code>aggr_score</code> (in the simplest form, a mean of the log2FoldChange values for all the genes of a set) can be easily computed with the <code><a href="../reference/get_aggrscores.html">get_aggrscores()</a></code>, which appends these scores for each gene set to the original <code>res_enrich</code> data frame.</p>
<p>The interactive flavor in this tab permits a quick exploration of the signature heatmaps for the genesets of interest by simply clicking on a node; this also triggers the display of some HTML content, if related to a Gene Ontology term.</p>
<p>A demonstration of how to use this panel effectively is provided by the tour, triggered by clicking on the</p>
<button id="tour" type="button" class="btn btn-default action-button" style="color: #0092AC; background-color: #FFFFFF; border-color: #ffffff">
<i class="fa fa-question-circle" role="presentation" aria-label="question-circle icon"></i>

</button>
<p>button in the upper right corner of the tab.</p>
<p>In the section below the interactive enrichment map, the functionality for the <em>distillation</em> of gene sets into meta-genesets is provided.<br>
In brief, a community detection algorithm is run on the graph underlying the enrichment map, and the additional information extracted is rendered as a table, linked to a meta-geneset box to display the expression signature for all its member genes.</p>
<p><strong>Bookmarking from the Enrichment Map panel:</strong> If the user clicks on the Bookmark button while in this tab, it will add the selected node to the shortlist of genesets, visible later in the Bookmarks panel. The Left Ctrl button of your keyboard can again be used for this purpose, and this will trigger a notification in the lower right part of the screen.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-overview-panel">The Overview panel<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-overview-panel"></a>
</h3>
<p>This panel presents to the user a series of summary plots, based on the outputs of <code><a href="../reference/enhance_table.html">enhance_table()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/gs_volcano.html">gs_volcano()</a></code>, aiming to provide a mean to summarize the most relevant genesets in the <code>res_enrich</code> object. The number of displayed (or labeled, according to each function) genesets can be as usual controlled by the widget in the right sidebar.</p>
<p>We avoid (re)rendering all plots at once by placing them as content of different tabs in a <code>bs4TabCard</code> container - this allows the user to navigate in a more agile way to the desired output elements.</p>
<p>Interactive versions of the plots are returned via calls to <code>ggplotly</code>.</p>

<h3 id="the-gsviz-panel">The GSViz panel<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-gsviz-panel"></a>
</h3>
<p>This panel, similarly to the Overview panel, presents a variety of plots visualizing the gene sets - and their mutual relationships, or their behavior across samples. This includes, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>a genesets by sample heatmap (via <code><a href="../reference/gs_scores.html">gs_scores()</a></code> and <code><a href="../reference/gs_scoresheat.html">gs_scoresheat()</a></code>), with a score for each matrix element corresponding to the sum of the standardized expression values of its components</li>
<li>a genesets-gene Sankey diagram (via <code><a href="../reference/gs_alluvial.html">gs_alluvial()</a></code>, aliased to <code><a href="../reference/gs_alluvial.html">gs_sankey()</a></code>), to represent the N:N membership relationships</li>
<li>a summary heatmap (via <code><a href="../reference/gs_summary_heat.html">gs_summary_heat()</a></code>) to display the memberships and at the same time the expression change of each gene set member</li>
<li>a multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plot, based on <code><a href="../reference/gs_mds.html">gs_mds()</a></code>, to provide a 2d visualization of the distance among genesets (based on a similarity measure e.g. their overlap or other criteria, such as their semantic similarity)</li>
<li>a compact summary of <code>res_enrich</code>, via <code><a href="../reference/gs_summary_overview.html">gs_summary_overview()</a></code>, where aggregated scores and significance can be displayed on the same plot - for this, there are functions to compare different <code>res_enrich</code> objects (<code><a href="../reference/gs_summary_overview.html">gs_summary_overview()</a></code>, <code><a href="../reference/gs_summary_overview_pair.html">gs_summary_overview_pair()</a></code>)</li>
<li>alternative visual representation of the <code>res_enrich</code> objects, based on <code><a href="../reference/gs_radar.html">gs_radar()</a></code> (equivalent to <code><a href="../reference/gs_radar.html">gs_spider()</a></code>) and <code><a href="../reference/gs_dendro.html">gs_dendro()</a></code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As in many other panels, the control over the number of genesets displayed is tweaked with the widget in the right sidebar, “Number of genesets”.</p>
<p>A demonstration of how to use this panel effectively is provided by the tour, triggered by clicking on the</p>

<h3 id="the-bookmarks-panel">The Bookmarks panel<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-bookmarks-panel"></a>
</h3>
<p>In this panel, the user can obtain a complete overview on the bookmarked features of interest, both genes (left side) and genesets (right side).</p>
<p>During a live exploration session, it might be tricky to recall the exact aspect of each point of interest.</p>
<p>Below the interactive <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/DT/man/datatable.html" class="external-link">DT::datatable</a></code> objects, the content of each table can also be separately downloaded by clicking on the respective button. Moreover, there is a button (with the cocktail icon <i class="fa fa-cocktail"></i>) that triggers the generation of a content-rich report which will focus on all the shortlisted elements. This leverages a template report delivered as a part of <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em>, which accesses the input elements and the reactive values for the bookmarks, based on the <code><a href="../reference/happy_hour.html">happy_hour()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>If a user already knows a set of features and geneset of interest, it is also possible to practically call <code><a href="../reference/happy_hour.html">happy_hour()</a></code> directly from the command line (see the example in the chunk below). Please keep in mind that the identifiers to be used should match the values used as row names of the <code>dds</code> object and as <code>gs_id</code> column of the original <code>res_enrich</code> input.</p>

<p>This report will serve as a useful means to generate a permanent and reproducible analysis output, that can be further stored or shared.</p>
<p>Ideally, each live session with <code>GeneTonic</code> could terminate with a call to <code><a href="../reference/happy_hour.html">happy_hour()</a></code> - admittedly, an aperitivo should start with that, and not end - please accept our apologies :) .</p>

<h2 id="faqs">FAQs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#faqs"></a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Why is this package called <code>GeneTonic</code>?</strong></p>
<p>A: For obvious reasons :) Like in a cocktail, ingredients (expression matrix, results from DE, and results from functional enrichment analysis) do taste better together.<br>
Plus, I like puns with words.<br>
And cocktails.<br>
Sometimes simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Q: My configuration on two machines is somewhat different, so I am having difficulty in finding out what packages are different. Is there something to help on this?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, you can check out <em><a href="https://github.com/federicomarini/sessionDiffo" class="external-link">sessionDiffo</a></em>, a small utility to compare the outputs of two different <code>sessionInfo</code> outputs. This can help you pinpoint what packages might be causing the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I am using a different service/software for generating the results of functional enrichment analysis. How do I plug this into <code>GeneTonic</code>?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can set up a small conversion function, on the line of <code>shake_topGOtableResult</code> and <code>shake_enrichResult</code> (<em>use the source, Luke</em> to see how you can build your own), or request such a function - make sure to specify the formatting specifications of your tool of choice (e.g. DAVID, g:Profiler, or commercial solutions such as Ingenuity Pathway Analysis).<br>
As of Bioconductor release 3.12 (version &gt;= 1.2.0 for <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/GeneTonic" class="external-link">GeneTonic</a></em>), shaker functions are available for these tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>DAVID</code> (<a href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/" class="external-link uri">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/</a>), with the result exported in text format</li>
<li>
<code>topGO</code> (available in the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/topGO" class="external-link">topGO</a></em> package), as in the wrapper function provided by <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/pcaExplorer" class="external-link">pcaExplorer</a></em>, <code>pcaExplorer::topGOtable()</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>Enrichr</code> (<a href="https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/" class="external-link uri">https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/</a>), either from text format or from a call via the <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=enrichr" class="external-link">enrichr</a></em> package</li>
<li>
<code>fgsea</code>, taking the output of the workflow from the <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/fgsea" class="external-link">fgsea</a></em> package</li>
<li>
<code>g:Profiler</code> (<a href="https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/" class="external-link uri">https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/</a>), either from text file format or with the output of <code>gost()</code> in <em><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gprofiler2" class="external-link">gprofiler2</a></em>
</li>
<li>
<code>clusterProfiler</code>, providing <code>enrichResult</code> objects, commonly returned by <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/clusterProfiler/man/enrichGO.html" class="external-link">enrichGO()</a></code> from <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/clusterProfiler" class="external-link">clusterProfiler</a></em> or <code>enrichPathway()</code> from <em><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.15/ReactomePA" class="external-link">ReactomePA</a></em>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q: I’d like to try <code>GeneTonic</code> but I could not install it/I just want a quick peek into it. What can I do for this?</strong></p>
<p>A: We set up an instance of <code>GeneTonic</code> running on the <code>macrophage</code> dataset at this address: <a href="http://shiny.imbei.uni-mainz.de:3838/GeneTonic" class="external-link uri">http://shiny.imbei.uni-mainz.de:3838/GeneTonic</a>.</p>
